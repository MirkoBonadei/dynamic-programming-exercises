# Dynamic Programming Exercises

Dynamic programming is one of the most fascinating algorithm techniques. 

It is used to solve complex problems breaking them down to simple subproblems which will be solved only once.
Subproblems' solutions are stored in memory to reach a good "time vs space" tradeoff.

The term "dynamic programming" was invented by [Richard E. Bellman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_E._Bellman) in the 40s and the reason behind both terms "dynamic" and "programming" can be found [here] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_programming#History).
